## Introduction

Welcome to the Arcade Ga,e repository! This game is a project in the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. The task was to implement the game with the provided assets.

## Getting started

To get started, first download the repository, open `index.html` and the game will load, ready to play!

## How To Play

On the board, there is water on one end of the board. You start off on the other side. The objective of the game is to reach the water as many times as you can. Each time you reach the water, your character will go back to the begin and your wins will go up! Sounds easy, right?

Oh, I forgot to add that there are enemies lurking around to stop you! Touch one of these bad-boys and your wins will reset :(

See how many times you can reach the water. Try and beat your own high score as well!

You also get to choose your own character, so feel free to pick your favourite one. :D
